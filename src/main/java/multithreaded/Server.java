/**
 * MULTI-THREADED SERVER                                         March 2024
 * <p>
 * This Server accepts multiple client connections and manages a connection
 * with each client using a Thread per client. There is only one server.
 * For each connection accepted, a new ClientHandler object is created to handle
 * the communications with that Client. The ClientHandler is initialized on
 * construction with the socket created to communicate with the client.
 * The ClientHandler implements the Runnable interface, (it is a Runnable)
 * The server then passes the client handler into a new Thread, and ClientHandler
 * run() method runs in the thread and continues to independently communicate with
 * the client.
 * <p>
 * The server uses the client handler to process requests from clients, and
 * sends appropriate responses back to the client.
 * <p>
 * The following PROTOCOL is implemented:
 * If ( the Server receives the request "Time", from a Client ) then : the
 * server will send back the current time.
 * If ( the Server receives the request "Echo message", from a Client ) then :
 * the server will send back the message.
 * If ( the Server receives the request it does not recognize ) then : the
 * server will send back the message "Sorry, I don't understand".
 * This is an example of a simple protocol, where the server's response is based
 * only on  the client's request.
 * <p>
 * Each client is handled by a ClientHandler running in a separate worker Thread.
 * Because the thread runs independently, the server code continues to execute
 * and continually listens for new client requests and create handlers for those clients.
